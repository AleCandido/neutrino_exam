# Practical exercises

## Recompute CC DIS cross sections

- easily improve the PDF set
- not so easy to improve theory
  - we might have a chance with small-x resummation
- impossible to do better than `Rojo`

## Improve unitarity bound

- might be interesting
- made use of LO CC DIS

### TODO

- check if it has already been done
